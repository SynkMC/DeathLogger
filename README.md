This very simple plugin allows you to log many informations about players when they die, such as their location, inventory, or death message.

Here are a few examples:

Here you can see my inventory before I die
![bfore-die](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf26ed89-0929-48b5-962d-b61a368ba851)


And then I can see my inventory and death message<br>
![getdeath](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd93540c-ce27-48fb-bb2a-7cace586dd76)


Requirements:
- LuckPerms (or any permission plugin)

Commands:
- /lastdeaths <player> - shows the last times the player died
- /getdeath <id> - open the player's inventory before their death

Permissions:
- deathlog.last - allows you tu use the lastdeaths command
